<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Trial periods and warranties:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re new to hearing aids or are trying out a new type, make sure you have wiggle room to return them if they don’t work for you.</li><li><strong>Visibility:</strong>&nbsp;Some hearing aids are completely invisible. Others have small, unobtrusive wires or behind-the-ear parts that can be seen. Your hearing ability, hairstyle, and comfort are factors that may influence your choice.</li><li><strong>Streaming capability:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth streaming enables you to listen to media and phone calls through your hearing aids, hands-free.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong>&nbsp;Hearing aids can be very expensive and aren’t always covered by insurance. Never look to cut costs by buying used hearing aids or defunct models. Instead, look for hearing aids that work within your budget or those that come with payment plans.</li><li><strong>Battery type:</strong>&nbsp;Hearing aids may be rechargeable or use very small, disposable batteries. If you have issues with hand dexterity, you may be better off with a rechargeable model.</li><li><strong>Noise reduction:</strong>&nbsp;All hearing aids reduce noise to some extent. Find out the level of noise reduction you can expect in the environments that are important to you, such as restaurants and windy, natural settings.</li><li><strong>Program changes and adjustments:</strong>&nbsp;Hearing aids may be adjusted via a remote control, app, or by touching the hearing aid itself.</li></ul>

<h2><a>Frequently asked questions about hearing aids</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are answers to some common questions about hearing aids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How can I get a hearing exam?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you work with a healthcare professional such as an audiologist, they’ll give you a full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/audiology">audiogram</a>, or hearing test, which provides concrete information about your level of hearing loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They can also explain the differences between hearing aid styles and make a recommendation about which style might be best for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Audiologists may not offer the same variety of brands and styles that you might get from an online retailer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you purchase hearing aids through an online retailer, you may have the option of taking an online hearing test. These tests may be accurate, but may not be as comprehensive or personalized as some people would like.</p>

<h3>Should I get fitted for a hearing aid?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research from 2013Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;studied why a group of individuals chose not to wear hearing aids, and, along with other reasons, some people chose to opt out of wearing their aids due to an uncomfortable fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid this, make sure the ones you choose fit correctly and feel comfortable in your ears, even after all-day wear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Do my hearing aids need extra technology?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people need certain technological functions added to their hearing aids, such as the ability to pair them with their phones. Others simply want to put their hearing aids in and forget about them. Choose hearing aids that accommodate your unique situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What can I do if I have tinnitus?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have tinnitus, look for a hearing aid that specifically addresses this condition. Many hearing aids come with apps that provide built-in tinnitus therapy sounds or reduce overstimulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Are hearing aids covered by Medicare or insurance?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing aids can be expensive, and while not usually covered by insurance or by Medicare, it’s possible to find ones that work for you and ways to cover the costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shop around for the best price. Many online retailers and big-box stores sell hearing aids at deep discounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask if the price you’re paying is bundled or unbundled. Unbundling the costs of your hearing aids may eliminate line items you have no use for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing aids are an investment, so make sure to only purchase those that come with a risk-free trial of at least 30 days, as well as a manufacturer’s warranty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What’s the difference between hearing aids and PSAPs?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure you purchase an FDA-regulated medical device instead of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-hearing-aid-otc">personal sound amplification product (PSAP)</a>. PSAPs are sold over the counter and don’t need an audiogram. They’re not meant to be used by people with hearing loss.</p>
