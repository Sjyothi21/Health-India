<p>Motives for drinking alcohol — such as coping with negative emotions or fitting in with peers — can influence not only how much a person drinks, but also their risk of developing problematic drinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While a person’s drinking motives can vary depending on the situation, a new study found that certain motives were consistent among university students across all four years of school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study also suggests that there may be a genetic basis to drinking motives that links them to alcohol consumption and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol use disorderTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;(AUD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AUD is a condition in which a person has a hard time stopping or controlling their use of alcohol in spite of the harmful effects it has on their health, relationships or job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/alcohol-facts-and-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 National Survey on Drug Use and HealthTrusted Source</a>, nearly 15 million people ages 12 and older had AUD. This includes over 400,000 12- to 17-year-olds who had AUD.</p>

<p>Earlier&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/heritability-of-alcohol-use-disorders-a-metaanalysis-of-twin-and-adoption-studies/37CACC30305F59E2522864E2FD9CA272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;found that genetic factors are responsible for about 50% of a person’s risk of developing AUD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the relationship between genes and problematic drinking is complex, with thousands of genetic variants involved, “each with very small effects,” wrote the authors of the new study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To help understand the biological basis of alcohol misuse, the researchers sought to determine whether drinking motives act as an intermediary factor between a person’s genes and their patterns of alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>The new study was published Oct. 18 in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acer.14930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research</em>Trusted Source</a><em>.</em></p>

<h2><a><strong>Drinking motives and alcohol consumption</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drinking motives or basically the reason why a person decides to pick up a drink can be negative or positive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They include more negative reasons including responding to unpleasant emotions (coping), an urge to fit in with peers (conformity) versus more postive reasons such as a desire to experience the pleasurable effects of alcohol (enhancement), or part of spending time with others (social).</p>

<p>Past&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735805000759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;has linked drinking motives to patterns of alcohol consumption, including heavy drinking and problematic drinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Drinking motives are thought to contribute meaningfully to both how much a person drinks and the alcohol-related problems a person might experience,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/alittlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Littlefield</a>, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Texas Tech University, who was not involved in the new study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, he said drinking motives are considered to be a more closely-related predictor of alcohol consumption and misuse, compared to other factors such as personality traits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/psychology/faculty/faculty-directory/read.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer P. Read</a>, PhD, a professor and chair of the Department of Psychology at the University at Buffalo, said research has linked drinking motives to alcohol use and misuse over both the short-term and the longer-term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, a person’s drinking motives on a given day is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469554/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linkedTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;to their drinking behaviors on that day, she said. Likewise, drinking motives at one point in time can also predict drinking&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22925011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcomesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;months or even years later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certain drinking motives can have a larger impact on drinking behavior than others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Generally speaking, coping motives — drinking to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782758/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copeTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;with or alleviate negative emotions or stress — have been most strongly implicated in harmful drinking outcomes,” said Read.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Littlefield said drinking to enhance positive moods can also have a stronger impact on alcohol&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8992737/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcomesTrusted Source</a>, compared to motives such as drinking to fit in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, these relationships “might also vary depending on the sample one has collected,” he said, “such as a sample of college students versus a sample of individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorders.”</p>
