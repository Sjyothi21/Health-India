<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo is a newer hearing aid brand. Their devices were designed by an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, for people with mild to moderate hearing loss in the high frequency range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo’s three hearing aid models are sold directly to the consumer and are described as self-fitting. You don’t need to visit an audiologist or provide a prescription to purchase Eargo hearing aids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company says it aims to serve people with hearing loss who have avoided getting a hearing aid because they think it’s unsightly, makes them look old, or because they can’t afford it. Eargo hearing aids are about half the cost of some of their competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, we’ll look at the four Eargo models, how they work, and some pros and cons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Pros and cons of Eargo hearing aids</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo has many advantages for those with mild or moderate hearing loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Eargo pros</h3>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is Eargo?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo, founded in 2010, was featured by&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454218/-max/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a>&nbsp;magazine as one of the 50 best inventions of 2018. As of June 2020, Eargo reported that they had sold 42,000 hearing aids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funded by venture capital, the California-based company went public on NASDAQ in October 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified Eargo hearing aids as medical devices, and some insurance policies cover their cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo was modeled after a fishing fly, with patented soft medical-grade silicone fibers (Flexi Fibers or Flexis) that hold it in place, and “floating” in your ear canal. There’s a tiny, transparent fiber that enables you to pull out the hearing aid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Flexi Fibers come in two sizes to fit most ears. The flexible design allows natural air circulation in your ear, according to the company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo amplifies only specific sound frequencies to compensate for mild to moderate hearing loss. The hearing aids enhance high frequencies so you can hear speech clearly, and simultaneously reduce background noise. Low frequencies are able to enter your ear naturally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing amplifier devices or personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), in comparison, amplify all sounds, or make everything louder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With four settings in all, you can personalize your setting profiles for phone, TV, outdoor, or group situations. To go from one setting to the next, tap your ear twice. The hearing aid will tell you which setting you’re on. The Neo HiFi model can also be controlled via a smartphone app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo hearing aids amplify sounds that are in front of you, compared with behind-the-ear models that can amplify sounds coming from behind you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How Eargo works</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing aids come in a kit that includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>left and right hearing aids</li><li>charger with a USB cord</li><li>cleaning cloth and brush</li><li>extra Flexi TetraPalms (which help hold the hearing aids in place)</li><li>extra wax guards and wax guard changing tool</li><li>small portable container</li><li>user manual</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eargo website has a series of short videos that explain and demonstrate the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>how to insert and remove the hearing aids</li><li>how to clean them</li><li>how to program the settings</li><li>how to change the Flexis and wax guards</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/4540/redirect?lp=328&amp;amp;tc=120226&amp;amp;subid2=%2Fhealth%2Feargo-review&amp;amp;subid=eargo_leadform_universal_textlink_5001&amp;correlationId=fc01eb68-afc8-42da-8d33-565ea38b3259">GET STARTED WITH EARGO</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Eargo charging and cleaning</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo hearing aids are designed to be taken out and charged overnight in the portable charger. According to the company, they charge fully in 6 hours and give about 16 hours of use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The box has LED lights inside to help you see where to place the hearing aids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On an ongoing basis, the hearing aids need to be brushed and wiped clean with the included brush and microfiber cloth before charging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The brand states that the tiny internal wax guard needs to be changed every 3 to 6 months, depending on wax buildup. A small tool is provided for this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Flexis need to be changed every 3 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The charger can be left unplugged from the USB cord, but it needs to be fully recharged weekly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Starting with clean ears</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo emphasizes that when you start using the hearing aids, your ears must be clean, with no wax buildup. Wax interferes with hearing aid performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re not sure that you can remove all of your earwax at home, Eargo advises that you see a professional for a cleaning. This can be done at a doctor’s office by a nurse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Getting started with Eargo hearing aids</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may take some time for you to get fully used to your hearing aids. Eargo notes, for example, that your ear may feel itchy at first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You also may have to get used to hearing your own voice, which can take a week or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, Eargo advises that you start at lower settings, as soft sounds may sound too loud until your brain adjusts to distinguishing background noise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo notes that after a few weeks, you should find it easier to hold a conversation, even in a noisy background situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you need help at any time in the process, you can call Eargo and speak with a certified hearing professional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Eargo hearing aids</a></h2>

<h3>Does Eargo offer a free sample trial period?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h3>Should I use Eargo if I don’t have severe hearing loss?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Is Eargo just an amplifier?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eargo’s devices are hearing aids, not just amplifiers. This means that Eargo hearing aids use technology to make specific sounds louder while reducing other sounds, like background noise. An amplifier, on the other hand, simply makes all sounds louder.</p>
