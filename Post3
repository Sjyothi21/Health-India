<p>According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), about&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing">15 percent of U.S. adultsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;experience some difficulty hearing.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/age-related-hearing-loss">older</a>&nbsp;a person is, the more likely they are to develop what NIDCD refers to as “disabling hearing loss.” This is defined as hearing loss of 35 decibels or more in at least one ear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re experiencing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hearing-loss">hearing loss</a>&nbsp;and looking to buy a hearing aid, you may want to consider Miracle-Ear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-Ear is a well-known brand with thousands of retail locations in the United States. Unlike retailers that sell lower-cost&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-hearing-aid-otc">personal sound amplification products (PSAPs)</a>, Miracle-Ear’s devices are true hearing aids.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a breakdown of Miracle-Ear’s pros and cons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is Miracle-Ear?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-Ear sells FDA-approved hearing aids. You can&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.miracle-ear.com/book-an-appointment?correlationId=36d00d9d-29ec-48e8-a97e-46d8687b2d22">book an in-person appointment</a>&nbsp;on the Miracle-Ear website.

<h3>Pros</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>FDA-approved.</strong>&nbsp;Unlike many PSAPs that are readily available online, Miracle-Ear’s hearing aids are FDA-approved.</li><li><strong>Free hearing test.</strong>&nbsp;You need to take a hearing test to qualify for Miracle-Ear hearing aids. The test is available online.</li><li><strong>Lifetime upkeep services.</strong>&nbsp;Miracle-Ear offers multiple ongoing services when you purchase one of their hearing aids, including regular cleaning and adjustments.</li><li><strong>Variety of options.</strong>&nbsp;Miracle-Ear sells several hearing aid models, including options worn behind and inside the ear.</li><li><strong>Custom fitting.</strong>&nbsp;Unlike some online PSAPs, Miracle-Ear’s hearing aids are custom-fit by professionals.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Cons</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Expensive.</strong>&nbsp;Prescription hearing aids are pricey, and Miracle-Ear’s products are no exception. However, the company does have a foundation that provides hearing aids to those who are unable to afford them.</li><li><strong>Locations aren’t available everywhere.</strong>&nbsp;You’ll need to visit a retail location to get a full assessment and prescription. While Miracle-Ear has many brick-and-mortar stores around the country, there may not be one close to your home.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What types of hearing aids are available through Miracle-Ear?&nbsp;</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-Ear offers a few different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-hearing-aids">forms of hearing aids</a>, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>in-the-ear (ITE)</li><li>receiver-in-canal (RIC)</li><li>behind-the-ear (BTE)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re looking for an invisible hearing aid, opt for an ITE device. They’re custom-molded to fit right inside your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/ear-canal#1">ear canal</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An RIC hearing aid has a speaker that fits right inside the ear canal. They’re a little larger than ITE models, but they’re still reasonably discrete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BTE hearing aids offer the highest level of sound amplification, but they’re more noticeable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of Miracle-Ear’s various hearing aid models are available in different forms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Special features of Miracle-Ear devices include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Speech isolation.</strong>&nbsp;Devices amplify speaking sounds above others to make it easier to follow speech.</li><li><strong>Tinnitus control.</strong>&nbsp;This feature helps to drown out annoying sounds that are the result of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tinnitus">tinnitus</a>.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Miracle-EarMINI is available in ITE or RIC versions. Both options are small and discreet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They offer custom ear models to help find the right fit. Weighing just 1 gram, their lightness makes them a sleek, comfortable option. However, Miracle-Ear’s rating scale marks them low for robustness—and indicator of overall reliability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Miracle-EarMINI also offers tech features, such as directional microphones, bluetooth connectivity and feedback cancellation.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Miracle-EarCONNECT line features Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to use your hearing aid(s) like headphones. You can connect to devices, like your phone, tablet, or TV.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These hearing aids are available in BTE and RIC styles.</p>

<p>The Miracle-EarENERGY devices have rechargeable batteries and Bluetooth connectivity. They’re available in RIC and BTE styles.</p>

<p>Though they have a sleek design, they are the heaviest of the options at 2.6 grams. They’re also the most technologically advanced of Miracle-Ear’s lineup, which may account for the weight.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-EarEASY hearing aids, available in RIC and BTE styles, are the most affordable of the bunch, so they have fewer features. For example, they don’t have Bluetooth connectivity, rechargeable batteries, and are not waterproof. They’re relatively discreet, with the same size and weight dimensions of the Miracle-EarCONNECT.</p>

<h2><a>How much do Miracle-Ear hearing aids cost?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-Ear hearing aids vary in price based on the level of hearing loss that will need to be corrected, as well as the technology and features included. According to their website, their hearing aid price falls between $1,000 and $4,000. More specific information on price can be determined after the hearing evaluation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The price of Miracle-Ear hearing aids also includes a variety of services, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>custom fitting</li><li>lifetime aftercare:<ul><li>cleaning</li><li>repairs</li><li>yearly hearing tests</li></ul></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most models come with a 3-year limited warranty. You can also return your hearing aid within 30 days if you’re not happy with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-Ear hearing aids are more expensive than most over-the-counter PSAPs. However, unlike PSAPs, Miracle-Ear hearing aids are FDA-approved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Prescription hearing aids vs. PSAPs</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be tricky to tell a PSAP from a prescription hearing aid, especially since some companies market their PSAPs as hearing aids.<br><br>The FDA doesn’t regulate PSAPs the same way they do hearing aids. While a medical hearing aid requires a prescription, a PSAP doesn’t.<br><br>Unlike hearing aids, PSAPs aren’t custom-fit. They also don’t treat hearing loss. They’re only capable of amplifying sound.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Can you use insurance to buy Miracle-Ear hearing aids?&nbsp;</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most Miracle-Ear locations take major insurance plans, but that doesn’t necessarily mean your insurance will completely cover the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cost-of-hearing-aids">cost</a>. They may only cover part of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can always&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.miracle-ear.com/contact-us?correlationId=4d3c8c35-40a1-4ac4-bb86-e7ee143685ef">contact Miracle-Ear</a>&nbsp;and get in touch with your insurance provider to find out about available coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some Miracle-Ear locations also offer financing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miracle-Ear also has a non-profit called the Miracle-Ear Foundation. It provides hearing aids to people without insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>Alternatives to Miracle-Ear hearing aids</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are a few other options to consider when shopping around for hearing aids:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Widex:&nbsp;</strong>This company has a similarly long history on the market, and offers both ITE and BTE hearing aid models. Like Miracle-Ear, Widex does not sell hearing aids directly online, requiring customers to come in for a hearing test and fitting.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.widex.com/?correlationId=b18647f1-4198-49f7-9f1f-5965324d8a0f">&nbsp;Learn more about Widex</a>.</li><li><strong>Starkey:</strong>&nbsp;This brand is known for offering high-tech features.

<h2><a>When to see a doctor</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be difficult to know if you have trouble hearing. Sometimes, it’s your friends and family who notice first. If people frequently tell you that you ask them to repeat themselves or you have the TV on too loud, it may be worth talking with a doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, if you find that your hearing isn’t what it used to be and you have trouble following conversations in loud spaces or on the phone, you may need to get your hearing checked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why does it matter? Hearing loss may be treatable, and in some cases, hearing issues can be linked to an underlying medical cause that requires attention.</p>
